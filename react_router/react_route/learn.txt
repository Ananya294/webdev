what i sreact router dom, v6 vs v7
why we need link/ navlink
why not a tag and why link - a tag re-renders the whole page so purpose of react is defeated
navlink - to highlight the active page - can write own css
link - no class as of such
isActive, isPending, activeClassName
useParams
outlet
loader
useloaderData
single page application
multi page application
there are may rendering methods - about 10(as in fireship video)
frameworks depend on which rendering we want


so,
we craeted routes in main.jsx (no need of app.jsx)
we craeted layout - layout.jsx - fixes header footer else all is dynamic - used outlet
useParams - for user/:id type of routes
how to use - loader - useloader data - optimal than doing fetching in component and changing state
now how loader optimizes - so fetches data as we hover over github before clicking - so data is ready before so faster

we laernt 2 types of how to write routes, nest routes
