how prop works
prop drilling:
{
    Passing props is a great way to explicitly pipe data through your UI tree to the components that use it.
    But passing props can become verbose and inconvenient when you need to pass some prop deeply through the 
    tree, or if many components need the same prop. The nearest common ancestor could be far removed from the 
    components that need data, and lifting state up that high can lead to a situation called “prop drilling”.

Context: an alternative to passing props 


what was teh problem with passing prop component inside component
state mgmt lib - redux(toolkit,react), zustand

done through - useContext Hook, no external library needed

why cant you just create global folder to get the values of props? it can be midifed at any instance by anyone - not good


steps
1. create context(.js file)
